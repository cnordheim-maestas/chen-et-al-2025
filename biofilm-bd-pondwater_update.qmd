## 2A Stats and assumption testing

Question:

Does the difference in Bd from day 1 to day 7 differ between the two filter types?

The samples are essentially paired by site, so a paired t-test is most appropriate

$H0:μ_{difference in Bd}=0$

Assumptions:

Assumes that the observations from each group represent a random sample from the population. Assumes that the difference of the two observations follow a normal distribution.

### 2A Test: Paired t-test on the difference in all of the Bd from day 1 to day 7 between the two filters

### 2A Stats results:

**There is a significant difference in the change in the total quantity of Bd from Day 1 to Day 7 across the filter types (t = 4.7879, df = 14, p-value = 0.000289)**

```{r}
# check normality of the differences across groups: it's normal untransformed in both!
partI_total_diff_40um %>% 
 ggqqplot("rate_loss", title = "Untransformed Bd in both floating and floating rate_loss between day 1 and 7 qqPlot") # good enough
shapiro.test(partI_total_diff_40um$rate_loss) # normal, yay!
hist(partI_total_diff_40um$rate_loss) # good enough

partI_total_diff.22um%>% 
 ggqqplot("rate_loss", title = "Untransformed Bd in both floating and floating rate_loss between day 1 and 7 qqPlot") # gorgeous
shapiro.test(partI_total_diff.22um$rate_loss) # normal, yay!
hist(partI_total_diff.22um$rate_loss) # good enough

# visualize the comparison I am making
partI_total_diff %>%
ggplot(aes(y= rate_loss, x = filter)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("Visualizing comparison for paired t-test on the rate_loss")
```

Pond water with microbes has a significantly greater loss of Bd between day 1 to day 7 than pond water without microbes (t = 4.8, df = 14, p = 0.000289). The t-value is positive, which shows that the first item entered (with microbes) has a larger loss of Bd than the second item entered (no microbes.) Df of 14 is expected, because it's 15 sites.

Stats

```{r}
# Step 3: run the paired t-test on the difference
t.test(partI_total_diff_40um$rate_loss, partI_total_diff.22um$rate_loss, paired = TRUE)
```

# 3A: Effect of the East Bay aquatic environmental biofilm on Bd growth - "9 sites"

Statistical question: Is there a difference in Bd quantity in the biofilm between day 1 & 7?

## 3A Data Wrangling

#---- Part II
# set as factors with levels so they appear in order in plots later
part_two$site <- factor(part_two$site,
                                levels = c("CABIN", "GRAMPS", "WEST", "GDPND005", "GDPND006", "GDPND009", "PRPND004", "PRPND009", "PRPND010"))

# Biofilm only, no supernatant, and days 1 and 7 only, no day 0
part_two_bf_only <- part_two %>% 
  filter(bd_location == "biofilm") %>%

## PII Assumptions testing and Stats

Question:

Does the amount of Bd in the biofilm differ between day 1 and day 7?

The samples are essentially paired by site, so a paired t-test is most appropriate

$H0:μ_{difference in Bd}=0$

Assumptions:

Assumes that the observations from each group represent a random sample from the population. Assumes that the difference of the two observations follow a normal distribution.

Check assumptions

```{r}
# check normality of the differences across groups let's try untransformed
part_two_bf_only %>% 
 ggqqplot("bd_qty", title = "Untransformed Bd loads") +
  facet_wrap(~day) # gotta transform the data, day 1 is not normal

part_two_bf_only %>% 
  ggqqplot("log_qty", title = "Transformed Bd loads") +
  facet_wrap(~day) # not perfect but close, let's try shapiro tests

# Shapiro tests
day_one <- part_two_bf_only %>% 
  filter(day == "Day_1") %>% # filter to only include day 1
  pull(log_qty)

shapiro.test(day_one) # p >> 0.05, it's normal!

day_seven <- part_two_bf_only %>% 
  filter(day == "Day_7") %>% # filter to only include day 1
  pull(log_qty)

shapiro.test(day_seven) # p >> 0.05, it's normal!

# Histograms for funsies
part_two_bf_only %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = log_qty)) + # x-axis
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) + # make a histogram
  facet_wrap(~ day, # make multiple panels by day
             scales = "free") # let the axes vary between panels
```

Stats

```{r}
# Step 3: run the paired t-test
t.test(day_one, day_seven, paired = TRUE)
```

**There is significantly more Bd in the biofilm on Day 1 than on Day 7 (t = 10.094, df = 8, p-value \< 0.0001)**

# 4A: Effect of microbes in pond water on the Bd-release from mono-strain Bd biofilm - "9 sites" and included biofilm

Scientific Q: Is mono-strain Bd biofilm resistant to microbes in pond water

Statistical question:

Is there a difference in the **gain or loss of ADHERENT Bd over 6 days** between the **filter sizes**?

**There is a significant difference in the change in the quantity of adherent Bd from Day 1 to Day 7 across the filter types (t = -6.45, df = 7, p-value = 0.0003)**

## PIII Stats and assumption testing

Question:

Does the difference in Bd from day 1 to day 7 differ between the two filter types?

The samples are essentially paired by site, so a paired t-test is most appropriate

$H0:μ_{difference in Bd}=0$

Assumptions:

Assumes that the observations from each group represent a random sample from the population. Assumes that the difference of the two observations follow a normal distribution.

### Test: Paired t-test on the difference in total Bd between day 1 and 7

```{r}
# check normality of the differences across groups
# With microbes (40 um)
eb_monolayer_diff_40um %>% 
 ggqqplot("rate_loss", title = "40um") # normal
shapiro.test(eb_monolayer_diff_40um$rate_loss) # normal, yay!
hist(eb_monolayer_diff_40um$rate_loss) # looks good

# Without microbes (0.22 um)

Stats:

```{r}
# Step 3: run the paired t-test on the difference
t.test(eb_monolayer_diff_40um$rate_loss, eb_monolayer_diff.22um$rate_loss, paired = TRUE)
```

### Stats results:

When monolayer Bd biofilm is exposed to pond water without microbes has a significantly greater loss of Bd between day 1 to day 7 than pond water with microbes (t = -5.4, df = 8, p = 0.0006772). The t-value is negative, which shows that the first item entered (with microbes) has a smaller loss of Bd than the second item entered (no microbes).

## Second stats Q: qty \~ factor(day) + microbe_treatment, random = \~1\|factor(site)

Question: does the quantity of Bd differ across days and treatment while controlling for the paired site?

This will be a lme since it is a mixed effects model!

## 2b Stats

Most appropriate comaprison for study design: day*microbes*water_treatment

-   y variable: amount of Bd

-   x vars: day, TB y/n, water_treatment (pw with microbes, pw without, sterile water)

Question: Does the amount of Bd in the sample differ across the treatments of presence of water type (pw with microbes, pw without, sterile water), TB, and day?

Model: Linear model

Note: anovas, lm's and glm's are all linear models!

## null

```{r}
null <- lm(log_adh_plus_sup ~ 1,
  data = pw_noday0)
AIC(null) #326.4356

```

## Try ANOVA with interactions: Bd \~ day\*TB\*water_treatment

**important: does not pass anova assumption that resids are normally distributed**

I tried different transformations with no luck either :(

Note: Kruskall wallace isn't the best move here because I want interactions, if I cut the interactions, a normal anova works, so no need for a KW

```{r}
# build model
# all interactions
mod3 <- aov(log_adh_plus_sup ~ day*TB*water_treatment,
  data = pw_noday0)

# diagnostic plot
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(mod3) # NOT normal...

# STOP: not normally distributed resids so can't interpret
```

## GLM Bd \~ day\*TB\*water_treatment

Normal distribution GLM

**Results**

1.  Day : Day 3 \> Day 1 = Day 5 \> Day 7

2.  TB: With TB = more Bd than no TB (p \<.0001)

3.  Water treatment: any treatment with MO has lower Bd, sterile water and microbe free pond water are the same (p = 0.0629), pond water with microorganisms has less Bd than sterile water (p \< 0.001), and pond water with MO has less Bd than pond water without (p \< 0.001)

4.  Interactions are all significant, except TB:water_treatment. I recommend putting these in a table, rather than listing them here, but 5 & 6 summarize them

5.  Day and presence of TB: After day 1, there was less Bd in treatments without TB, but on day 1, there was no difference

6.  Day and water treatment: across all days, the water treatment trend holds that presence of MO will have lower Bd than without. However, there are nuances between the sterile water and the filtered pond water.

    1.  on days 5&7 sterile water had more Bd than pond water without microbes, but on day 1, sterile water had more Bd than pond water with no microbes, but on day 3, there was no difference.

```{r}
# normal distribution, should be relatively the same as the anova
mod3_glm <- glm(log_adh_plus_sup ~ day * TB * water_treatment,
                data = pw_noday0,
                family = gaussian(link = "identity"))

## 3b Stats

Keep interaction, skedasticity isn't "too bad", and will show underlying data in plot to be super transparent

y var: amount of Bd in adherent

x vars: day & medium with the AE biofilm and Bd (MQ, TB, PW)

Bd \~ day\*medium

Question: Does the amount of Bd in the aquatic environmental biofilm differ across the media tested and across the days, and do they interact with each other?

Model: 2-way ANOVA

**Summary of results**

Bd qty Day 1 \> Day 3 \> Day 5 \> Day 7 (all p \<0.005) in other words, Bd significantly reduced each day

MQ+AEbiofilm \> PW+AEBiofilm \> 1%TB+AEbiofilm (all p \<0.005) In other words, TB plus biofilm has most Bd inhibition power, followed by pond water, then by milliQ with the least inhibition power

```{r}
# quick check: we want day as a FACTOR
ae_noday0 <- ae_noday0 %>% 
  mutate(day = as.factor(day)) %>% 
# column for medium
mutate(medium = sample_ID)

Commented out to save space, log transformed is better

```{r}
# # untransformed
# ml_noday0 <- monolayer %>%
#   filter(day != 0) %>%
#   mutate(log_adh = log(adh)) # note: no zeroes so not log + 1
# ggqqplot(ml_noday0, "adh", title = "untransformed")
# shapiro.test(ml_noday0$adh) # nope
# hist(ml_noday0$adh) # note
# 
# # transformed
# ggqqplot(ml_noday0, "log_adh", title = "log transformed") # gorgeous
# hist(ml_noday0$log_adh) # better
```

## 4b Stats

y var: amount of Bd

x vars: day, treatment, microbes y/n, pw y/n, tb y/n

Best model: Bd \~ day\*microbes\*TB

Question: Does the amount of Bd in the sample differ across the treatments of presence of microbes, TB, and day?

Model: 3-way ANOVA

**results**

Results summary

-   day (p\<0.05)

    -   All differ from each other except 5 and 7 (Tukey)

        -   Day 1 \> Day 3 \> Day 5 = Day 7

-   microbes (p\<0.05)

    -   presence microbes has less Bd (Tukey)

-   TB (NOT SIG)

-   day:microbes (p\<0.05)

-   day:TB (NOT SIG)

-   microbes:TB (p\<0.05)

-   day:microbes:TB (NOT SIG)

```{r}
ml_noday0 <- monolayer %>%
