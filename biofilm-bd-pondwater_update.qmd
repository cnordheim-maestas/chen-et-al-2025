## PI Stats and assumption testing

Question:

Does the difference in Bd from day 1 to day 7 differ between the two filter types?

The samples are essentially paired by site, so a paired t-test is most appropriate

$H0:Î¼_{difference in Bd}=0$

Assumptions:

Assumes that the observations from each group represent a random sample from the population. Assumes that the difference of the two observations follow a normal distribution.

### Test: Paired t-test on the difference in all of the Bd from day 1 to day 7 between the two filters

### Stats results: 

**There is a significant difference in the change in the total quantity of Bd from Day 1 to Day 7 across the filter types (t = 4.7879, df = 14, p-value = 0.000289)**

```{r}
# check normality of the differences across groups: it's normal untransformed in both!
partI_total_diff_40um %>% 
 ggqqplot("rate_loss", title = "Untransformed Bd in both floating and floating rate_loss between day 1 and 7 qqPlot") # good enough
shapiro.test(partI_total_diff_40um$rate_loss) # normal, yay!
hist(partI_total_diff_40um$rate_loss) # good enough

partI_total_diff.22um%>% 
 ggqqplot("rate_loss", title = "Untransformed Bd in both floating and floating rate_loss between day 1 and 7 qqPlot") # gorgeous
shapiro.test(partI_total_diff.22um$rate_loss) # normal, yay!
hist(partI_total_diff.22um$rate_loss) # good enough

# visualize the comparison I am making
partI_total_diff %>%
ggplot(aes(y= rate_loss, x = filter)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("Visualizing comparison for paired t-test on the rate_loss")
```



Pond water with microbes has a significantly greater loss of Bd between day 1 to day 7 than pond water without microbes (t = 4.8, df = 14, p = 0.000289). The t-value is positive, which shows that the first item entered (with microbes) has a larger loss of Bd than the second item entered (no microbes.) Df of 14 is expected, because it's 15 sites. 


Stats

# Step 3: run the paired t-test on the difference
t.test(partI_total_diff_40um$rate_loss, partI_total_diff.22um$rate_loss, paired = TRUE)

## PII Assumptions testing and Stats

Question:

Does the amount of Bd in the biofilm differ between day 1 and day 7?

The samples are essentially paired by site, so a paired t-test is most appropriate

$H0:Î¼_{difference in Bd}=0$

Assumptions:

Assumes that the observations from each group represent a random sample from the population. Assumes that the difference of the two observations follow a normal distribution.

The samples are essentially paired by site, so a paired t-test is most appropriate

$H0:Î¼_{difference in Bd}=0$

Assumptions:

## PIV Data visualization

Exploratory:

```{r}

  ggplot(aes(y= rate_loss, x = treatment, fill = filter)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.1) +

### Takeaways

Key comparison: PW 40 um vs Monolayer 40 um: "The addition of a monolayer Bd to pond water leads to a significantly slower death rate of Bd; in other works, the addition of a monolayer Bd to pondwater protects the Bd from microbes"!

Key comparison: Field bf vs pw 0.22: "A natural biofilm increases the Bd death rate compared to not having anything present, AND it increases the Bd death rate as much as the microbes in pond water!

Key comparison: Field bf vs monolayer 0.22: "A monolayer Bd in the absence of microbes has a lower Bd death rate than a field biofilm, in other words, a Bd monolayer is more protective than a natural biofilm!

# Is my raw data normal?

## Part 1 alternate route

### "Difference" Another way to measure the change in Bd

We decide not to use this, rate_loss makes the most sense

check the "diff" *diff = Day_1 - Day_7 then log the difference if needed

```{r}
# check normality of the differences across groups: it's normal untransformed in both!
partI_total_diff_40um %>% 
 ggqqplot("diff", title = "Untransformed Bd in both floating and floating diff between day 1 and 7 qqPlot") # good enough
shapiro.test(partI_total_diff_40um$diff) # normal, yay!
hist(partI_total_diff_40um$diff) # good enough

partI_total_diff.22um%>% 
 ggqqplot("diff", title = "Untransformed Bd in both floating and floating diff between day 1 and 7 qqPlot") # gorgeous
shapiro.test(partI_total_diff.22um$diff) # normal, yay!
hist(partI_total_diff.22um$diff) # good enough

# visualize the comparison I am making
partI_total_diff %>%
ggplot(aes(y= diff, x = filter)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("Visualizing comparison for paired t-test on the differences")
  
```

Stats: 

```{r}
# Step 3: run the paired t-test on the difference
t.test(partI_total_diff_40um$diff, partI_total_diff.22um$diff, paired = TRUE)
```

## Part 2 alternate route: use day 0,1,7 and lme

Mixed-effects model 

Outcome variable: amount of Bd
Fixed effect: day
Random effect: site

### LME

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# wrangle
part_two_bf_only  <- part_two_bf_only  %>% 
  mutate(log_qty = log(bd_qty))

# visualize
psych::pairs.panels(part_two_bf_only)
part_two_bf_only %>%
 ggqqplot("log_qty", title = "log_qty") # good enough
  shapiro.test(part_two_bf_only$log_qty) # normal, yay!
  hist(part_two_bf_only$log_qty) # good enough?
mod <- aov(log_qty ~ day, data = part_two_bf_only) # couldn't use "plot" on lme so this was next best thing?
plot(mod) # good enough resids?


# Model for randomized block design
lme_mod <- lme(log_qty ~ factor(day), random = ~1|factor(site),  data = part_two_bf_only)
summary(lme_mod) # summary of the output
anova(lme_mod) # suse anova table to determine if the fixed effect of day is significant

emmeans::emmeans(lme_mod, pairwise ~ day) # pairwise comparisons

emmeans::lsmeans(lme_mod, pairwise~day, adjust="tukey") # pairwise comparisons

```

There is an overall effect of Day on the amount of Bd detected in the field biofilm (p > 0.001). Specifically, there was more Bd in the field biofilm on day 1 than day 0 (p <.0001), but there was significantly less Bd in the biofilm on day 7 than on day 1 (p <.0001), and there was no difference in the amount of the Bd on day 0 and day 7 (p=0.43). The test is a linear mixed effects model (the model is the log transformed Bd quantity ~ day, random = ~1|site) with a post hoc pairwise comparison using the emmeans package. 

## Part 3 alternate method: diff

### diff not rate loss method, ignore for now

```{r}
# Assumptions testing

# check normality of the differences across groups
part_three_total_diff_40um %>% 
 ggqqplot("diff", title = "40 um") # not great
shapiro.test(part_three_total_diff_40um$diff) # NOT normal
hist(part_three_total_diff_40um$diff) # nope

# we gotta transform, and note we have negative: west GAINED Bd
part_three_total_diff_40um <- part_three_total_diff_40um %>% 
  mutate(log_diff = log(diff)) # warning: NaN's produced

part_three_total_diff_40um %>% 
  ggqqplot("log_diff", title = "40 um") # good enough
shapiro.test(part_three_total_diff_40um$log_diff) # woohoo!!
hist(part_three_total_diff_40um$log_diff) # sure

# 0.22 micron

# check normality of the differences across groups
part_three_total_diff.22um  %>% 
 ggqqplot("diff", title = ".22 um") # not great
shapiro.test(part_three_total_diff.22um $diff) # shapiro says its fine
hist(part_three_total_diff.22um $diff) # meh

# we gotta transform, but we have negative: west GAINED Bd
part_three_total_diff.22um  <- part_three_total_diff.22um %>% 
  mutate(log_diff = log(diff))

part_three_total_diff.22um  %>% 
  ggqqplot("log_diff", title = ".22 um") # better?
shapiro.test(part_three_total_diff.22um $log_diff) # woohoo!!
hist(part_three_total_diff.22um $log_diff) # sure

# visualize the comparison I am making
part_three_total_diff %>%
ggplot(aes(y= diff, x = filter)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
  scale_y_log10()+
  ggtitle("Visualizing comparison for paired t-test on the differences")
```

Stats: 

```{r}
# Step 3: run the paired t-test on the difference
t.test(part_three_total_diff_40um$log_diff, part_three_total_diff.22um$log_diff, paired = TRUE)
```

Same trend, yay!

**Note: df = 7? It should be 8, look into any NaN's that may have been produced during log transformation**
