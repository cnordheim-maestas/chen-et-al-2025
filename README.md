# README

This is the repository for the paper in review by Renwei Chen, Caitlin Nordheim-Maestas, and Cherie Briggs "Double-Edged Effects of Aquatic Environmental Biofilms on Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Growth and Inhibition", in review in  ISME Comms

Each quarto document (ending in .qmd) corresponds to a different set of experiments from the paper. This repository contains the raw data for experiments 2 onward, as experiment 1 was imaging based, and all files are in the paper and supplements. Each quarto document has a breif overview of the experiment in the beginning of the document, a full data workflow, statistics, and the creation of the figures for the paper, including the SI figures. 

Please do not hesitate to contact the creater and manager of this repository, Caitlin Nordheim-Maestas, if you have any questions at Caitlinnordheim<at>ucsb.edu
